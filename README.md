## OW API

This server is a simple way to get read-only information about players and heroes in Overwatch.  
**A live version runs on https://owapi.net.**
 
## API Docs

OWAPI has a very simple RESTful API to get information.  
As the API is read-only, the only method required is `GET`.

See the [doc](/api.md) for more information.
