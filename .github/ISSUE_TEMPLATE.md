Hi! Thank you for helping OWAPI by submitting an issue.
Before you submit, please make sure you've done the following:

* [ ] Google/Search previous issues to make sure it hasn't been answered before.

* [ ] Ask if this is an *OWAPI* issue, or a *Linux* issue, etc.
    * OWAPI requires Python 3.5 or higher installed on a UNIX machine, and it's not really our job to troubleshoot random Linux errors.

Thanks!
